The Hub, in this instance: [ YVR Hub ] is a community tool. It handles accounts, events, attendance, poap minting and a generative NFT profile picture based on community contribution.

Members who contribute in the community will get noticed. Other members can vouch for them on certain aspects of organizing events: Social media, buying food, cleaning, bartending, etc.

These social contributions will be turned into badges. Members can display their badges on their profile and on their on chain member card.

In YVR Hub, the app also controls a physical space: Dctrl Vancouver.

It leverages existing infrastructure (raspberry pi's with hardware support) to control the door, a can vending machine and a snack vending machine. Dctrl was funded by vending pop for BTC in the early days.
The treasury of the machine is still used for rent. This app will add omnichain EVM support to the existing infrastructure. Eventually, I will create a gitcoin grant page and open source the code so people
can also create their own dectralized communities around the world. Eventually, we will make backend connectors between nodes and create a decetralized network of communities. For now, it is property of Tani

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
